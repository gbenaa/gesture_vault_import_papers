# Manichaeism

Manichaeism is a dualistic religion founded by the prophet Mani in the 3rd century CE, teaching that the universe is a struggle between the forces of light (spirit) and darkness (matter). It blended elements of Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Buddhism, and aimed to free the soul’s divine light from the material world through knowledge and ascetic living.
