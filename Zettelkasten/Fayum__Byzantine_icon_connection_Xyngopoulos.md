"there can be no doubt that portraits like those found in the Fayum are the forebears of icons" - Note 33 "An idea expressed by, among others, the late scholar [[Xyngopoulos, Andreas]], who considered it 'natural to suppose that the icon of the Evangelist Mark (for instance) was painted by Christians and preserves his actual facial features' (Athena G. Kalogeropoulos, 'The Gospel of Melenikos in the National Library. Memorial for University Professor and Academician Andreas Xyngopoulos', Kathimerini, 21 Aug. 1993, p. 10; my translation)."
