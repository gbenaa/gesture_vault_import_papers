“During this period, the personality and teaching of Saint Gregory Palamas, which were at the core of the Hesychast controversy, were almost totally forgotten. They were rediscovered only in the mid-20th century, through the scholarly work of pioneers such as father [[Dumitru Stăniloae]], [[John Meyendorff]], [[Christou Panayiotis]]” ([Tomoioaga, 2015, p. 143](zotero://select/library/items/2C8JPAH7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9BFMVJT?page=2&annotation=3NDXKP8V))

“The rehabilitation of Gregory Palamas in the Western Church during the twentieth century is a remarkable event in the history of scholarship, and the inclusion of a volume of Palamas in a series bearing the title “Classics of Western Spirituality” is itself a remarkable symbol of that rehabilitation (Palamas 1983:XI).” ([Tomoioaga, 2015, p. 144](zotero://select/library/items/2C8JPAH7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9BFMVJT?page=3&annotation=L4LPEZX9))
