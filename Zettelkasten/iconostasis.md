“iconostasis began as a mere barrier, known as a [[templon]], which separated the space of the Eucharistic sacrament from the congregation” ([Shin, 2020, p. 40](zotero://select/library/items/6RW5WGJL)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9SVEXQV3?page=3&annotation=LGZL3HIR))

“The monks’ paintings are placed in the iconostasis to create a wall that in Orthodox churches separates the altar, as the holiest space, from the nave, where the faithful pray. The tension between the hearts that ‘behold’ God and the hands that ‘veil’ him points to the paradoxical dynamic of iconic representation, which offers a reflection on the human-divine relationship as requiring both proximity and distance” ([Rzepa, 2021, p. 228](zotero://select/library/items/7B2TSM4N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=242&annotation=UANC5NRV))
