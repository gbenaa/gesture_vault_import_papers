In studying the origins of icon painting, we will see how the work of the artist is undertaken in parallel with the art of self-perfection, just as we find the origins of style in early Christian art in the Mediterranean culture of the first to fifth centuries AD, so we will seek the origins of artistic philosophical meaning in that Hellenistic milieu.

"We will begin with a study of those earliest paintings, undoubtedly forerunners of the icons, which are known as Fayum portraits"

"They are dated from approximately the first to the fourth centuries AD"
