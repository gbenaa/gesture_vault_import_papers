“in the course of time people’s belief in God’s divinity led to an inner transformation that has had real effect on the structures of their inner selves, and in that sense their relation to the divine is authentic, and God becomes real.” ([Rzepa, 2021, p. 202](zotero://select/library/items/7B2TSM4N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=216&annotation=3ZEJZQ24))

Similar to something I recall mentioned by [[Cynthia Bourgeault]]
