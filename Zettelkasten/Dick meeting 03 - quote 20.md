# Dick meeting 03 - quote 20
There has to be practical exercises to start to create this relationship between something higher ^c997d2

whether it's **the higher self or the light or the Lord, or I don't know, and one's ordinary self**, are looking at each other, recognising each other's existence.

One will never conquer the other. My lower self will be there until I breathe my last breath. I read somewhere that the associations go on for several days after you're dead. I wouldn't be surprised.  ^08ae17
