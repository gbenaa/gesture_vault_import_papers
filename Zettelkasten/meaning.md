“The icon, thus, becomes a vessel that is revived by the contemporary viewer-supplicant in an experiential manner. Just like liturgical [[gesture]]s, it acquires [[meaning]] through a prayerful event in which its form undergoes interpretation by a modern believer” ([Rzepa, 2021, p. 222](zotero://select/library/items/7B2TSM4N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=236&annotation=KD9Y7FWR))

“both the traditional form of the icon and the individual experiences of the artist and the viewer hold value, and the meaning of the icon is born in their encounter” ([Rzepa, 2021, p. 221](zotero://select/library/items/7B2TSM4N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=235&annotation=BMM4BYTH))

“the medieval icon—similarly to the medieval dogmas in the modernist theologians’ interpretation—does not seem to have a timeless, inherent [[meaning]] of its own. Its meaning is [[relational]], born in an encounter with the viewer-supplicant” ([Rzepa, 2021, p. 222](zotero://select/library/items/7B2TSM4N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=236&annotation=U5W2FAK5))
