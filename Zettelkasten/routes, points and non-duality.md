# routes, points and non-duality

**

when navigating a route, there will be points of elevated danger along that route in particular given other events and people we happen to encounter around those points. We are unlikely, in particular without foreknowledge of the route and its structure, to be aware, especially in advance, of those elevated risks. Without careful forethought, we are also unlikely to be aware that such a structure may even exist. events will occur around these points, and from the perspective of the structure itself, which also has an ontological reality, if it has or had a consciousness would have a different perception - associated less with the events themselves, but with the points concerned. The events are happening to the structure, just as much as the structure is happening to those involved in the events. An external viewer would be able to observe this easily, in a way not so by those in motion.

  

The ontological reality that emerges is a product of the structure and the events occurring in relation to it 

  

some such principle where the route is not as physically manifest as a road. more symbolic 

  

the route has an existence by virtue of our journey on it just as we perceive the journey itself

  

alluding to no duality

  

or extramission

or Eckhart

  

as the journeys emerge, so does the route, and the points along it
