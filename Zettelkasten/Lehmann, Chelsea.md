# Lehmann, Chelsea

Chelsea Lehmann explores the iconoclastic gesture—acts of breaking, erasing, or disrupting images—as a way to interrogate the painted body, revealing its materiality and challenging cultural assumptions, especially around female representation. Through both historical examples and her own practice, she shows how destruction can serve as a creative force, generating new meanings from layered, wounded, and re-signified images
