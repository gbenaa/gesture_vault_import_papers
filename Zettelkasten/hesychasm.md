“Hesychast spirituality inspired new forms of personal and communitarian ascetic life, as is, for example, the movement from Essex, represented by the elder [[Sofronios Sacharov]]. It surely reshaped the theological discourse of Dogmatic Theology in the 20th century.” ([Tomoioaga, 2015, p. 143](zotero://select/library/items/2C8JPAH7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9BFMVJT?page=2&annotation=7EKWMNTI))

“I mention only a few representatives, namely [[Nikos Matsoukas]] in Greece; father [[Justin Popovich]] in Serbia; [[Vladimir Lossky]] in the Russian Diaspora, and, of course, father [[Dumitru Stăniloae]] in Romania” ([Tomoioaga, 2015, p. 144](zotero://select/library/items/2C8JPAH7)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9BFMVJT?page=3&annotation=FJM9NWXX))
