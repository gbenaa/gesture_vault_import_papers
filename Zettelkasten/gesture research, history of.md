 <mark class="hltr-yellow">"4. A concise history of gesture research  It is important to note that the author himself states that Gesture and Thought ‘. . . is not a comprehensive review of current work on current gesture work, and it is not a commentary on all that has been discovered about gestures, which is by now a great deal’ (p. 4). In his groundbreaking article on the history of gesture, Kendon (1982: 45) observes that ‘[g]esture has attracted the attention of scholars for many hundreds of years.’ In fact, in that article as well as chapters 3–5 of Gesture: Visible Action as Utterance, Kendon (2004: 17–83) provides an excellent overview of gesture research from classical antiquity through the twentieth century. The following all too brief account relies on Kendon’s (1982, 2004) chronicle of gesture research. In his historical account of gesture study, Kendon (2004: 17–42) begins by discussing ‘Western interest in gesture from Classical antiquity to the eighteenth century.’ He discusses Latin writers such as Cicero (106–143 BCE) in his De oratore (2001 [c. 56 BCE]) and Quintilian (35?–95? CE) in Institutio oratoria (Quintilianus 1922 [95 CE]), which contains a fairly detailed discussion of gesture (Aldrete 1999; Dutsch 2002, Quintilianus 1922 [95 CE]). Selected additional noteworthy historical accounts of gesture include John Bulwer’s (1606–1656) Chirologia: or, the Natural Language of the Hand, and Chironomia or the Art of Manual Rhetoric (1974 [1644]). In addition, Gerard de Lairesse (1640–1711) produced Groot Schilderboek (‘Great Painting Book,’ 1738 [1707]), which addresses issues related to drawing and painting appropriate gestures. In the domain of acting, Johan Jakob Engel’s (1741–1802) Ideen zu einer Mimik (1785–1786) deals with gesture. Giambattista Vico (1688–1744), the Neapolitan philosopher, in his Scienza nuova (‘New Science,’ 1984 [1744]), speculated that language originated with gestures (Danesi 1993). Next, Kendon (2004: 43–61) examines ‘Four contributions from the nineteenth Century: Andrea de Jorio, Edward Tyler, Garrick Mallery, and Wilhelm Wundt.’ In fact, Kendon has written an introduction and notes to the translation of Andrea De Jorio’s (1769–1851) Gestures in Naples and Gesture in Classical Antiquity (De Jorio 2000 [1832]). Edward Tylor (1832–1917) is an originator of the subdiscipline known as cultural anthropology and author of Researches into the Early History of Mankind (1865), a work that focuses on how a study of gestures can inform us about language formation. Garrick Mallery (1831–1894), a colonel in the US Army and Head of the Signalling Division, wrote Sign Language among North American Indians Compared with That among Other Peoples and Deaf Mutes (1972 [1881]). Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920), founder of experimental psychology, wrote the twenty-volume work Volkerpscychologie, which contains a lengthy discussion of gestures in the first part of chapter two (Wundt 1973 [1921]). Finally, Kendon (2004: 62–83) provides an excellent overview of more recent gesture research in his chapter entitled ‘Gesture studies in the twentieth century: Recession and return.’ At the beginning of the twentieth century, interest in this area of research declined precipitously. Only a few significant works appeared in the first half of the century, among the are works by Critchley (1939), Efron (1941), and Wol¤ (1945). Furthermore, as Kendon (2004: 63) notes, in the two bibliographies on nonverbal communication that cover the period 1900–1981 (Davis 1972; Davis and Skupien 1982), a scant sixty-two entries address the category gesture. At the middle of the last century, the gradual initiation of a rebirth in gesture research began to take place. The occasional study produced by linguists from the American structuralist school and others appeared (Trager 1958; Hall 1959; Hall and Trager 1953). Ray Birdwhistell (1952, 1970), a professor at the University of Louisville, prior to his academic appointments at Temple University and New York University, developed an important classificatory scheme in the domain he labeled ‘kinesics.’ As interest increased in gesture and related research, two terms, ‘nonverbal behavior’ or ‘nonverbal communication,’ began to be used for such research. Kendon (2004: 70) points out a pivotal event in gesture research in 1955 at the Institute for Advanced Study of Behavioral Sciences at Stanford,”</mark> [Page 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/87T92G49?page=7&annotation=JFX73IWG)

###  A Concise History of Gesture Research

In *Gesture and Thought*, the author himself emphasises that the book “is not a comprehensive review of current work on gesture, and it is not a commentary on all that has been discovered about gestures, which is by now a great deal” (McNeill 2005: 4).

Kendon (1982: 45) notes in his seminal essay that “gesture has attracted the attention of scholars for many hundreds of years.” In both that article and chapters 3–5 of *Gesture: Visible Action as Utterance* (Kendon 2004: 17–83), he provides an authoritative overview of gesture research from classical antiquity to the late twentieth century. The following brief account is indebted to his historical survey.

#### Antiquity to the Eighteenth Century

Kendon (2004: 17–42) begins with the long tradition of Western interest in gesture. Classical authors such as Cicero (2001 \[c. 56 BCE]) in *De oratore* and Quintilian (1922 \[95 CE]) in *Institutio oratoria* discussed gesture in the context of rhetoric (see also Aldrete 1999; Dutsch 2002).

The seventeenth century saw renewed attention with John Bulwer’s *Chirologia* and *Chironomia* (1974 \[1644]). Later, Gerard de Lairesse addressed appropriate gesture in the visual arts in *The Art of Painting in All of Its Branches* (1738 \[1707]). Philosophical speculation on the origin of language through gesture appears in Giambattista Vico’s *New Science* (1984 \[1744]; see Danesi 1993). In the theatrical domain, Johan Jakob Engel explored acting and gesture in *Ideen zu einer Mimik* (1785–1786).

#### The Nineteenth Century

Four nineteenth-century contributions are central in Kendon’s account (2004: 43–61):

* **Andrea de Jorio (1832):** *La mimica degli antichi* (Eng. trans. *Gesture in Naples and Gesture in Classical Antiquity*, De Jorio 2000), documenting the continuity of Neapolitan gesture with classical traditions.
* **Edward Tylor (1865):** *Researches into the Early History of Mankind*, situating gesture as a key to understanding the formation of language.
* **Garrick Mallery (1881):** *Sign Language among North American Indians Compared with That among Other Peoples and Deaf Mutes* (reprinted 1972), the most comprehensive early study of indigenous sign languages.
* **Wilhelm Wundt (1921/1973):** *Völkerpsychologie* (*The Language of Gestures* in English translation), which integrated gesture into a broader psychological framework.

#### The Twentieth Century: Decline and Renewal

Kendon (2004: 62–83) characterises the twentieth century as one of “recession and return.” The first half of the century saw relatively little scholarship: important exceptions include Critchley’s *The Language of Gesture* (1939), Efron’s *Gesture and Environment* (1941), and Wolff’s *Psychology of Gesture* (1945).

Renewed interest emerged mid-century. American structuralist linguists such as Trager (1958), Hall and Trager (1953), and Hall (1959) began to include gesture in analyses of communication. Ray Birdwhistell’s *Introduction to Kinesics* (1952) and *Kinesics and Context* (1970) established a classificatory framework for gesture as part of “kinesics.” During this period, research was often labelled more broadly as “nonverbal communication” or “nonverbal behaviour” (Ruesch and Bateson 1951; Ruesch 1953, 1955; Ekman and Friesen 1969).

Bibliographic surveys illustrate the limited attention gesture still received: only sixty-two entries appeared under “gesture” in two major bibliographies of nonverbal communication covering 1900–1981 (Davis 1972; Davis and Skupien 1982).

Nevertheless, by the latter half of the century, interest was accelerating. McNeill’s *Hand and Mind* (1992), Armstrong, Stokoe, and Wilcox’s *Gesture and the Nature of Language* (1995), and Kendon’s own *Gesture: Visible Action as Utterance* (2004) consolidated gesture as a central subject of inquiry across linguistics, psychology, anthropology, and semiotics. Kendon (2004: 70) identifies a key turning point in 1955 at the Institute for Advanced Study of Behavioral Sciences at Stanford, which brought gesture firmly back onto the research agenda.
