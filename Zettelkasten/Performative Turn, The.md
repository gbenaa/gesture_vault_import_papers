# Performative Turn, The

The Performative Turn is a shift in the humanities and social sciences that emphasises performance, practice, and embodiment over static structures or representations. It began gaining traction in the 1980s and 1990s, drawing from disciplines such as anthropology, theatre studies, philosophy, linguistics, and cultural theory. [[J.L. Austin]]
