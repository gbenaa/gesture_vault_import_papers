“Rilke’s interest was in the relational space in which centuries-old iconographic forms can become a source of authentic religious experience for a contemporary believer. He asserts that both the traditional form of the icon and the individual experiences of the artist and the viewer hold value, and the meaning of the icon is born in their encounter” ([Rzepa, 2021, p. 221](zotero://select/library/items/7B2TSM4N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=235&annotation=9KU3B2KP))

“the medieval icon—similarly to the medieval dogmas in the modernist theologians’ interpretation—does not seem to have a timeless, inherent meaning of its own. Its meaning is relational, born in an encounter with the viewer-supplicant” ([Rzepa, 2021, p. 222](zotero://select/library/items/7B2TSM4N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=236&annotation=U5W2FAK5))
