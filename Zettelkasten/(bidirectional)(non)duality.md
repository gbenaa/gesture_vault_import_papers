“both the traditional form of the icon and the individual experiences of the artist and the viewer hold value, and the [[meaning]] of the icon is born in their encounter” ([Rzepa, 2021, p. 221](zotero://select/library/items/7B2TSM4N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=235&annotation=BMM4BYTH))

“Since the icon’s meaning, according to Florensky, is co-created by the viewer, as such, it cannot be prescriptively determined.” ([Rzepa, 2021, p. 224](zotero://select/library/items/7B2TSM4N)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=238&annotation=CAYTZ2FQ))
