“Some of Byzantine visual canons of making an image integrate the eternal prototype, reverse perspective, light, colour, and gesture. Once the image stamps its form in the icon-maker’s memory and the breath of the Holy Spirit touches his/her thoughts, the second stage is to imprint (hand made) or perform the likeness of the image, “like a seal” in wax, onto the surface of a wood panel.” ([Gorea, p. 27](zotero://select/library/items/X8HMF29A)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9FBFQR3?page=38&annotation=HIXQPW4Z))
