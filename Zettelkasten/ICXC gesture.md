# ICXC gesture

Translation from [[@didronIconographieChretienneHistoire1843]] (see below)
"This hand gives the Latin blessing and not the Greek blessing. In our country [France] The direction of the fingers does not seem symbolic, while among the Greeks the index finger lengthens like an I, the big finger curves like a C, ancient sigma of the Greeks, the thumb and ring finger cross to make an X. and the little finger rounds to represent a C. All this gives IC-XC, Greek monogram of Jesus Christ (Ιησούς Χριστός)."

“56 There is a modern tradition that this class of pointing gesture is supposed to mimic the shape of the Christogram – the first finger fully extended, the second and pinky slightly bend, and the middle crossed with the thumb spell out IC XC. (e.g. Desmond Morris, Postures: Body Language in Art (London: Thames & Hudson, 2019), 56-57.) However, I have not found evidence of this idea in any Byzantine sources.” ([Streiter, 2022, p. 43](zotero://select/library/items/USZKS6MZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=61&annotation=YFDKZPTN))
