“56 There is a modern tradition that this class of pointing gesture is supposed to mimic the shape of the Christogram – the first finger fully extended, the second and pinky slightly bend, and the middle crossed with the thumb spell out IC XC. Desmond Morris, Postures: Body Language in Art (London: Thames & Hudson, 2019), 56-57. However, I have not found evidence of this idea in any Byzantine sources.” ([Streiter, 2022, p. 43](zotero://select/library/items/USZKS6MZ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=61&annotation=YFDKZPTN))
