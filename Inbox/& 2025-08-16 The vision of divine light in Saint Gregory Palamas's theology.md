> abstract:: The Hesychast debates of the 14th century between the representatives of the Western and Eastern tradition over the issue of the light seen in the experience of prayer are still relevant nowadays. Gregory Palamas - who was the central figure of these debates - was rediscovered in the 20th century by Orthodox Theology and is still in the process of reception in Western theology. The present study represents a synthesis of Saint Gregory Palamas's teaching on the vision of Divine Light as it was articulated in the debate with his adversaries. Directly linked to this topic are other adjacent issues, namely the Transfiguration of Christ, the intellectual and themystical knowledge, the nature of the divine energies, the purpose of the Christian life, and so on. The entire study in couched in the frame of a personal reflection over the type of spirituality fit for contemporary man - a contemplative one of a mystical type or a much more practical one, based on social virtues?

Directly linked to this topic are other adjacent issues, namely the Transfiguration of Christ, the intellectual and the mystical knowledge, the nature of the divine energies”</mark> [Page ](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9BFMVJT?page=&annotation=CT9QJY3K) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"During this period, the personality and teaching of Saint Gregory Palamas, which were at the core of the Hesychast controversy, were almost totally forgotten. They were rediscovered only in the mid-20th century, through the scholarly work of pioneers such as father Dumitru Stăniloae, John Meyendorff, Christou Panayiotis”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9BFMVJT?page=2&annotation=3NDXKP8V) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"the Palamas teaching, especially the former controversial distinction between ousia and divine energies in God, is generally admitted in Orthodox theology at present”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9BFMVJT?page=2&annotation=GZ74JHJC) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Hesychast spirituality inspired new forms of personal and communitarian ascetic life, as is, for example, the movement from Essex, represented by the elder Sofronios Sacharov. It surely reshaped the theological discourse of Dogmatic Theology in the 20th century.”</mark> [Page 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9BFMVJT?page=2&annotation=7EKWMNTI) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"I mention only a few representatives, namely Nikos Matsoukas in Greece; father Justin Popovich in Serbia; Vladimir Lossky in the Russian Diaspora, and, of course, father Dumitru Stăniloae in Romania”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9BFMVJT?page=3&annotation=FJM9NWXX) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"His doctrine of divine light was rejected, because it postulated the possibility of seeing God with corporeal eyes (Lossky 1975:62)”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9BFMVJT?page=3&annotation=T9GDERAC) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"a certain aftertaste of Manicheism, almost imperceptible, which still remains in our (Western) piety and which at times makes us despise the flesh a little too much, not because of sin, but by virtue of its material nature (Lossky 1975:63)”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9BFMVJT?page=3&annotation=LF8UBCCQ)
