- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"three underlying modes of artistic vision that expose the metaphysical issues  of representation within today’s spectacle of technological screens: 1) a symbolic (Platonic)  seeing of the invisible as totally absent from the visible, 2) a realistic (Nietzschean) seeing that  claims the invisible as really present in the space defined by a viewer’s perspectival gaze, and 3)  a symbolic-realistic (Byzantine) vision of evoking the presence of an absent, invisible image  through a tangible creative experience”</mark> [Page 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9FBFQR3?page=3&annotation=8JEPLYG5)  ^652704
- <mark class="hltr-blue">"the Byzantine iconophiles”</mark> [Page 13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9FBFQR3?page=13&annotation=V49KGNXS) 
	- aka iconodule 
- <mark class="hltr-green">"Some of Byzantine visual canons of making an image  integrate the eternal prototype, reverse perspective, light, color, and gesture. Once the image  stamps its form in the icon-maker’s memory and the breath of the Holy Spirit touches his/her  thoughts, the second stage is to imprint (hand made) or perform the likeness of the image, “like a  seal” in wax, onto the surface of a wood panel.”</mark> [Page 38](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9FBFQR3?page=38&annotation=HIXQPW4Z) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Specifically, the icon performs the Incarnational economy directly  with the viewer to construct a (symbolic-realistic) mode of seeing the image that is not entirely  imaginary (symbolic) and not totally naturalistic (realistic)”</mark> [Page 38](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9FBFQR3?page=38&annotation=T9HMXD3I) 
- <mark class="hltr-blue">"the perspective of contemporary iconoclastic gestures manifested in today’s  screen culture of mobile screens, mass media and advertisement industry”</mark> [Page 59](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9FBFQR3?page=59&annotation=ABZI4RUU) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Both characters reveal/perform a transcendental  experience (symbolism) in concrete grabs (realism) encouraging the viewer&#39;s participation. By  portraying a quasi-hypostatic experience, the commodity, in addition to its symbolic, exchange  and use value, is now invested with a cult value”</mark> [Page 149](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9FBFQR3?page=149&annotation=YJMDLWZV) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"One of the main research questions that I explore in my artistic practice is if the canons of reversed perspective, light, color, and gesture are universally applicable to any type of images (religious, commercial, etc.).”</mark> [Page 151](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L9FBFQR3?page=151&annotation=8ZVZYZTX)
