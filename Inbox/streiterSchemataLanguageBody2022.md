- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Byzantine art is full of figures who communicate with their bodies. They bow,  fight, rest, pray, talk, listen, embrace, and perform a vast range of human activities.  Frozen in moments of perpetual action, their gestures (Greek, s. σχήμα, schema, pl.  σχήματα, schemata) form a silent, symbolic language that relates the figures to one  another, to the viewer, and to grounding ideologies of Byzantine life”</mark> [Page 19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=19&annotation=5WXVD875) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"middle Byzantine  images of bodies are often hard for today’s viewers to read”</mark> [Page 19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=19&annotation=I35WGZBV)

- <mark class="hltr-purple">"emotional or physical  distress, for instance while drowning in the Red Sea or suffering leprosy”</mark> [Page 19](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=19&annotation=34ADHIY5)

- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"to Chrysostom and other  patristic authors schema was an essentially performative term, suggesting “...the entirety  of the role one plays in the theater of life.””</mark> [Page 21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=21&annotation=WK2XM7B9) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"people,  guided by a principle of mimesis (or imitation), inevitably changed their natures in  response to their sense perceptions of the external, mutable world.”</mark> [Page 21](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=21&annotation=HNCHLVJA) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Chrysostom thought that the right performances – inspired and  expressed by the right schemata – could guide people toward a pure and holy Christian  life.”</mark> [Page 22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=22&annotation=QH28XARJ) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"by harnessing the human body to a regimented language of  physical motion, these images provided models for imitation.”</mark> [Page 22](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=22&annotation=38XDHRRM) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"middle Byzantine images use a schematic visual language that maintains the  importance of the body, but that trains viewers to think about bodies in relation to  immaterial ideals”</mark> [Page 23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=23&annotation=KDD44CT7) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"middle  Byzantine artists merged pictures of the body with complex messaging about politics and  theology”</mark> [Page 23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=23&annotation=IWMRMV45) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"artists were not so much inventors as curators, who shifted and  reframed images of bodies to comment on driving questions about the relationship  between the physical and the spiritual realms”</mark> [Page 23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=23&annotation=X5ZR3JNE) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Middle Byzantine body language demands to be read  within larger visual programs”</mark> [Page 23](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=23&annotation=SY7B8CQN) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"very few scholars have approached Byzantine body language as a meaningful  mode of communication”</mark> [Page 24](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=24&annotation=4MS9445F) 
- <mark class="hltr-green">"Research on gesture became more prominent in the second-half of  the twentieth century, when widely available audio-visual recording equipment made it  easier to preserve and encode the movements of experimental subjects.10 Since then, the  literature on body language has been heavily framed by human subject research.”</mark> [Page 25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=25&annotation=2IES37FS) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"the gestures of living  subjects are different from gestures found in art. For one thing, even if such a thing exists  in real life, there is no natural body language in ar”</mark> [Page 25](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=25&annotation=KR6MP9RF) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"this does not mean that images of bodies cannot engage with the messy  ambiguities of live communication, but rather that this engagement is always filtered  through the mind of an artist or through the practice of an artistic community”</mark> [Page 26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=26&annotation=NEX6B9VE) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Byzantine artists often used a raised hand and bent  elbow to signify speech. However, a speaking human might raise an arm during a  conversation, but probably would not leave it raised in one place for more than a moment  or two”</mark> [Page 26](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=26&annotation=SW2CQMI3) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"naïve to assume that images of body language are faithful  reflections of embodied behavior. While it is entirely possible that Byzantine people  sometimes crossed their arms to express respect or extended sharply bent elbows to  signify listening, it is not clear that the actual nonverbal vocabulary of living Byzantines  was as defined and regimented as it appears in art”</mark> [Page 27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=27&annotation=2SHFWQY6) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The tenth-century Book of Ceremonies,  which records extensive protocols for a wide array of religious and imperial festivals,  rites, and processions, offers little in the way of precise descriptions of ritual gestures”</mark> [Page 27](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=27&annotation=JL3YIJM5) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Art historians  have begun to tie research on body language to deeper questions about how bodies  communicate within cultures”</mark> [Page 28](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=28&annotation=5M9X8SLX) 
- <mark class="hltr-green">"a growing interest in the symbolic  meanings of nonverbal communication in the art and literature of the Western Middle  Ages”</mark> [Page 29](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=29&annotation=7X3ANHIU) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Very few  studies have considered how vocabularies of body language make meaning through the  shifting and reframing of form within individual artistic programs”</mark> [Page 29](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=29&annotation=527FH4JS) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The Roman authors Cicero (106 BCE-43 CE) and  Quintilian (c. 35-100 CE) both provide explicit commentary on practices of gesture in  Roman oratory and theater, but there are no comparable, surviving texts produced in  Byzantium”</mark> [Page 30](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=30&annotation=2NR8YGM9) 
- <mark class="hltr-green">"The best surviving references to Byzantine body language are dispersed in  texts like the Book of Ceremonies, which primarily deal with other subjects. They almost  never offer precise descriptions of distinct postures and gestures”</mark> [Page 30](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=30&annotation=LX795Q3N) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"In one particularly important chapter, Anthony Cutler’s Transfigurations:  Studies in the Dynamics of Byzantine Iconography (1975), reviews the evolving  iconography of Byzantine proskynesis (bowing) imagery, emphasizing the many forms  and contexts of the pose”</mark> [Page 31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=31&annotation=QKR2RL7E) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"He does not consider whether gestures gained new, contingent meanings in  specific visual programs”</mark> [Page 31](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=31&annotation=BYCS3EBZ) 
- <mark class="hltr-green">"The Icons of Their Bodies: Saints and Their Images in Byzantium  (1996), explores how Byzantine artists used shifting vocabularies of motion and  modeling to connect saintly figures to Christian virtues like apatheia (ἀπάθεια, the  conquest of passion and emotion) and presbeia (πρεσβεία, intimacy with God).29  These analyses of body language woven into larger arguments are perhaps most  useful to my project. They treat specific postures and gesture as intrinsic to the meanings  of individual artworks, and they lend weight to the idea that middle Byzantine images of  body language demand specific interpretations”</mark> [Page 33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=33&annotation=RAG4YQ6H) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Most importantly, scholars rarely confront  the process of translating living figures into art. The literature sometimes acknowledges  essential connections between living bodies and depicted ones, and it occasionally  focuses on the interrelations of images and rituals.30 However, it does not ask whether  images capture or even aim to capture the complexity and ambiguity of embodied  communication”</mark> [Page 33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=33&annotation=ML29RVTR) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Since scholars treat body language as  though it is comparable to other types of visual symbols, they elide the power that comes  from its intrinsic connection to human physicality”</mark> [Page 33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=33&annotation=I4IATACT) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"literature on middle Byzantine body language also tends to dwell on  individual images or on iconographic categories that are isolated from their full programs  and visual contexts”</mark> [Page 33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=33&annotation=EAYHZTIA) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"little emphasis on how images of body language generate particular meanings within specific visual programs”</mark> [Page 33](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=33&annotation=5SFDD98T) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"the bodies of individual figures gain their deepest meaning in relation to  larger image programs, and they therefore demand a close and broad comparative  analysis”</mark> [Page 34](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=34&annotation=E88KA6TJ) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"My approach to body language draws on contemporary research in several disciplines”</mark> [Page 34](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=34&annotation=EGQ6F7F2) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"distinguished by its emphasis on visual evidence”</mark> [Page 34](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=34&annotation=WSYZVU8E) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"he images that I discuss are always the product of artistic  process, which is learned and imitative. There is no question of natural body language in  art. Although paint surfaces may degrade and manuscripts may be damaged, images of  body language are far, far less ephemeral than actual human movements”</mark> [Page 34](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=34&annotation=U23LR48M) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"In this dissertation, there are no truly casual images of  nonverbal communication. Each painting reflects a process of intention and creation”</mark> [Page 34](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=34&annotation=3DJFQLGY) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"process often relied on a practice of copying, which was founded in 17  the Byzantine aesthetic of creative repetition.31 This process left significant room for  change and complexity but dwelled insistently on tradition”</mark> [Page 34](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=34&annotation=S8IIJKDF) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"my thesis that  depictions of Byzantine body language gained meaning in relation to a larger visual  program”</mark> [Page 35](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=35&annotation=XFCRL2MV) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"particular forms of body language can echo across a closely  gathered group of images”</mark> [Page 35](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=35&annotation=CDHZTRWZ) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Visual programs are prominent in many Byzantine media, for instance in church  painting, in multi-image icons, and in assemblages of liturgical or luxury goods, but  manuscripts have the advantage of allying images closely with written texts”</mark> [Page 35](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=35&annotation=6M7CMIS3) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"texts, and especially narrative texts, offer useful  supporting evidence about the resonances of Byzantine body language”</mark> [Page 35](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=35&annotation=EMIGZJKZ) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The Octateuchs represent speech primarily through a  nuanced iconography of hand gestures.”</mark> [Page 36](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=36&annotation=UZQIGPAX) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"ery little scholarly attention has been  paid to Byzantine speech gestures, and scholars regularly describe images of speech  casually, without reference to their particular forms, derivations, or meanings”</mark> [Page 36](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=36&annotation=5RWXAKTI) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"different manuscripts occasionally  use different speech gestures in images of the same narrative. Moreover, gestures of  ordinary speech sometimes look very much like other types of body language. My  analysis explores the messiness of represented gesture, arguing that it is an unfixed and  multivalent form of symbolism that accrues meaning through comparison”</mark> [Page 36](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=36&annotation=DPCJBJA4) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"middle Byzantine speech gestures sometimes employ a  varied and deliberate visual vocabulary that helps indicate the purpose of the speech and  the status of the speaker”</mark> [Page 36](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=36&annotation=R72UZ5VC) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"the hand of God descending from the vault of heaven to speak,  especially, to issue commands”</mark> [Page 36](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=36&annotation=FG6MPJ4C) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"these gestures appear in a variety of contexts, they carry an implication of divine  will or command. Holy figures frequently make this type of gesture in scenes where they  communicate God’s wishes. I show, however, that transgressive figures make this gesture  too, when they claim authority, especially spiritual authority, that they might not deserve”</mark> [Page 37](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=37&annotation=FECFYNUS) 
- <mark class="hltr-purple">"This class of speech gesture was used differently in the representation of men and  women, and its meanings could change depending on its specific mode of representation,  suggesting that it was a fluid, not a fixed symbol”</mark> [Page 37](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=37&annotation=3B85K73R) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"I frame the program, which draws  the viewer back and forth across the book, as a metaphor for movement across sacred and  earthly temporalities. I confront the book’s materiality and the way the readers’ physical  movement through its folios mirrors their imaginative movement through the liminal  spaces between the images and the ideas that the images represent”</mark> [Page 38](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=38&annotation=JUIYZH2S) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"the first two chapters look at individual instances of postures and gesture  and highlight creative or unexpected iconographic shifts”</mark> [Page 38](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=38&annotation=CD4U4P5N) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"It is unusual to find a continuous sequence of nearly identical narrative  illustrations in any middle Byzantine book.”</mark> [Page 39](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=39&annotation=RTVYC9IX) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Repeated gestures and compositional elements are key to understanding the Kokkinobaphos images in general, but only the Annunciation scene appears in multiple, almost identical depictions across several folios”</mark> [Page 39](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=39&annotation=8GXRX9JI) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"the subtle transformations of the Annunciation cycle happen in the viewer’s  mind, as the viewer turns the pages of the book, looking from one Annunciation to the  next”</mark> [Page 40](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=40&annotation=WSSEYSQD) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"the Annunciation cycle in  relation to processional icons of the Virgin Mary that gained major cultural importance in  Constantinople after Iconoclasm (726–87 and 815–43).”</mark> [Page 40](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=40&annotation=JFCWWY2C) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"I argue that they intentionally play with the limits and imaginative potential of represented body language, repeating the Annunciation scenes in order to simulate the movement of an icon through a physical space”</mark> [Page 40](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=40&annotation=68LZWAS3) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"narrative images,  which are activated through representations of kinesis, and static, iconic images, which  come alive through the intellectual and ritual gestures of their viewers and users”</mark> [Page 41](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=41&annotation=KYVN6A66) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Byzantine sacred images of body language are not simply or primarily  concerned with the expression of individual emotion and experience. Instead, they  express an ideal of divine reason that is married to human flesh and present in every  living person”</mark> [Page 41](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=41&annotation=EL2P9Q9D) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Byzantine sacred images force  viewers to move back and forth across visual programs, situating and subsuming  individual figures within larger theological frameworks that can define their cosmological  significance”</mark> [Page 41](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=41&annotation=ZJ4WRTVI) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"at the intersections between mind and body,  humanity and divinity, categories central to Byzantine thought.”</mark> [Page 41](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=41&annotation=3JM8LUJB) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"In short, Byzantine images of bodies form networks that make  meaning through their interconnections. They are connected within image programs and  across iconographies, and they reflect the cultural conception of real, embodied people  who lived and gestured in Byzantium”</mark> [Page 42](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=42&annotation=3TJWXVXF) 
- <mark class="hltr-blue">"The bar in  the middle of its initial epsilon is transformed into a human hand. Its back is to the  viewer, and its fingers are open, except for the ring finger, which is bent inward (figure  15)”</mark> [Page 43](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=43&annotation=H9J22CA2) 
- <mark class="hltr-purple">"the gesture itself is not unusual. In fact, it is the most common  middle Byzantine gesture used to represent speech in manuscript illuminations. It recurs 26  hundreds, if not thousands of times across the surviving corpus of middle Byzantine  illuminated books”</mark> [Page 43](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=43&annotation=SX2UF72E) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"I cannot see how the  outcomes of this debate would not have had great bearing on how actual, living  Byzantines appreciated, denied, or expressed their bodily impulses and how they  represented embodied intellect in art. In this chapter, I trace the impacts of this debate on  figural imagery in Byzantine sacred art, particularly in relation to gestures of speech  pictured in middle Byzantine manuscripts”</mark> [Page 44](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=44&annotation=QJCBKYSE)

- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"the gestures are significantly dispassionate.  There is no nuanced way for them to express vehemence, shyness, confidence,  seductiveness, ease, or any of the infinite states of emotion and intention that people  express with their bodies while they speak”</mark> [Page 49](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=49&annotation=VMZYH67Y) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Byzantine images in general use a rigorous system of visual hierarchy to differentiate  figures of different types and statuses. In this system, the largest, most central, most  symmetrical, and stillest figures are generally the most powerful ones, while less  important figures tend to be smaller and more peripheral and to have a greater range and  fluidity of motion”</mark> [Page 50](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=50&annotation=64LLP6F2) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Byzantines’ deep interest  in the virtue of taxis (τάξις, or harmonious order), which demanded a profound physical  self-control”</mark> [Page 50](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=50&annotation=NCSK2GKC) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"despite their devotion to steady corporeal order, the most important  figures in Byzantine art are allowed to make vivid speech gestures even in highly formal  and commanding scenes, and even when these speech gestures disrupt their stillness and  symmetry”</mark> [Page 50](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=50&annotation=68XK37MI) 
- <mark class="hltr-blue">"In Pantokrator images, Christ is still  and symmetrical, posed frontally, his stern gaze directed at the viewer”</mark> [Page 50](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=50&annotation=MYKHJ2CJ) 
- <mark class="hltr-purple">"raises his right hand in a gesture of speech, or perhaps more specifically, of  blessing (figure 16)”</mark> [Page 50](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=50&annotation=B8AQCSGQ)

- <mark class="hltr-purple">"Rather than subverting the rules of Byzantine visual order, the Pantokrator iconography suggests that the rules of Byzantine visual hierarchy do not apply to speech gestures. In it, speech is not simply a physical function and does not undermine the rules of orderly self-control, but rather embodies the word of God, that is, the Logos, which is represented by Christ’s speech gesture and the Gospel book. The body in Byzantine art is not simply a physical sign, it comes to represent the spiritual state of the different categories of figures, serving as a schematic model for Christian audiences”</mark> [Page 50](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=50&annotation=MP2559JY) 
- <mark class="hltr-blue">"The first, slightly more complex,  group of speech gestures is expressed by a raised or outreaching right hand, with the first  and middle finger extended, and the thumb meeting the ring finger and sometimes also  the pinky in front of the palm. The hand of the Pantokrator figure, pictured above, may  serve as an example of this type (figure 17)”</mark> [Page 51](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=51&annotation=J8VL23MB) 
- <mark class="hltr-blue">"This gesture is rendered with some variation.  For instance, the hand can face inward or outward and can point up, out, or down; the  first finger is sometimes fully extended and sometimes partly bent; and the pinky often is  not raised at all”</mark> [Page 51](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=51&annotation=QP3GG6ZZ) 
- <mark class="hltr-blue">"Moreover, this class of pointing gestures either includes or is closely  related to a version of the same gesture, also associated with speech, in which the first  finger and pinky are raised, but the ring and middle fingers are folded into the palm  (figure 18)”</mark> [Page 51](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=51&annotation=5AIKDVPA) 
- <mark class="hltr-purple">"Unlike other speech gestures which can be used in crowd scenes and in the  representation of ordinary people, these pointing gestures are used exclusively for figures  who are holy, powerful, or acting in exceptional (and sometimes subversive) ways”</mark> [Page 51](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=51&annotation=JTBDI9HV) 
- <mark class="hltr-purple">"Although modern scholars commonly note that these pointing gestures represent  speech and blessing, no one has yet disambiguated their different forms”</mark> [Page 51](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=51&annotation=5CNZKHLR) 
- <mark class="hltr-purple">"the best way to distinguish the meanings of these pointing gestures is to think carefully  about how they function in visual narratives. Who are the characters who make them? 34  What types of speech do they represent? Since the category includes several closely  related hand positions, which often look very similar”</mark> [Page 51](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=51&annotation=JFUEKZ8M) 
- <mark class="hltr-red">"it is especially important to  consider when small variations in gesture are meaningful and when they are the result of  casual artistic liberties”</mark> [Page 52](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=52&annotation=M7GNRJ87) 
- <mark class="hltr-blue">"The second type of speech gestures, or perhaps more precisely of discourse, is  very different from the one that Christ Pantokrator makes”</mark> [Page 52](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=52&annotation=AFL44SUA) 
- <mark class="hltr-blue">"a raised  right arm, crooked forty-five to ninety degrees at the elbow, with an open hand raised  between waist and shoulder height, palm upturned or facing inward and extended toward  the listener”</mark> [Page 52](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=52&annotation=77L95ZUE) 
- <mark class="hltr-blue">"this gesture appears, for instance, in Vat. gr. 747 (fol. 49v), the  earliest of the surviving illustrated Byzantine Octateuchs, in a two-part miniature that  illustrates Genesis 27:42-46, in which the biblical foremother Rebecca advises her son,  Jacob, and then speaks with her husband, Isaac (figure 19)”</mark> [Page 52](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=52&annotation=H6VBGWIN) 
- <mark class="hltr-blue">"Rebecca performs two  actions in this passage. She hears Esau’s words, and she speaks. The gesture is somewhat  ambiguous, but it is clear that she is engaged in conversation”</mark> [Page 52](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=52&annotation=7IRNAG4J) 
- <mark class="hltr-purple">"the gesture that Rebecca performs in these scenes can  have other meanings. It sometimes appears when two figures interact, but there is no  explicit textual reference to speech”</mark> [Page 53](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=53&annotation=II63C8FI) 
- <mark class="hltr-purple">"and it is sometimes employed in crowd scenes.”</mark> [Page 53](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=53&annotation=7PAE8EX4) 
- <mark class="hltr-purple">"It also  has important formal similarities to the gestures most commonly used to express listening  and making promises”</mark> [Page 53](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=53&annotation=LFMKFBKM) 
- <mark class="hltr-purple">"a class of gestures that express  walking or movement in general”</mark> [Page 53](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=53&annotation=6H3WCU5H) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"this class of speech gestures is fundamentally  multivalent and sometimes ambiguous. In order to understand such gestures, I look  closely and comparatively at the visual contexts in which they appear in the Octateuchs,  weighing their narrative functions and compositional uses”</mark> [Page 53](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=53&annotation=3L4EBSLV) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Both major categories of Byzantine speech gestures are complex and multivalent,  and both include subcategories that are closely interrelated in form and significance”</mark> [Page 53](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=53&annotation=T9Z5CUZG) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"to understand the meanings of both classes of speech gestures, it is essential to  study a large corpus of narrative illustration in which body language plays a major  iconographic role. The images in the group must be closely enough connected to each  other to express a coherent visual vocabulary”</mark> [Page 53](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=53&annotation=BXYHC24F) 
- <mark class="hltr-blue">"the Hand of God appears only in Vat. 747  (f. 24v). The other three image programs show instead an empty semi-circular zone,  representing the vault of heaven”</mark> [Page 55](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=55&annotation=B9M2MH2E) 
- <mark class="hltr-blue">"Ham raises an open left hand”</mark> [Page 55](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=55&annotation=TKVTUH8R) 
- <mark class="hltr-blue">"Ham’s  raised left hand is not open, and he instead holds his third finger bent to touch his thumb”</mark> [Page 55](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=55&annotation=QM8PAIVL) 
- <mark class="hltr-purple">"allow us to consider when small shifts in posture and  gesture do (or do not) create nuances in iconographic meaning”</mark> [Page 56](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=56&annotation=STBJJRK6) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Weitzmann (and his collaborators) understood the illustrated  Octateuchs as the descendants of a lost tradition of narrative biblical illustration, dating  back to late antiquity”</mark> [Page 56](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=56&annotation=MCQXL4KE) 
- <mark class="hltr-purple">"The gestures of the Hand of God probably derive from an old Roman oratorical  tradition. The extended first finger recalls the ad locutio gesture found in imperial Roman  monumental sculpture (figure 37). Ernst Gombrich traces the gesture back to the  conventional body language of Roman rhetoricians, in which, Gombrich states, it  suggested “any solemn announcement”</mark> [Page 61](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B79WZSND?page=61&annotation=EHQDPGKC)
