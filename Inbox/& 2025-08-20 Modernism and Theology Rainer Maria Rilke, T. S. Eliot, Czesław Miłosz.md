- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"And only those among the gods are great, whom no one knows; they need not answer the impetuous-throated who crave a god, and frantically call. But soon or late, the rabble, madness-bloated, summons the gods from their celestial hall, and in the desperate stare of the devoted they melt, they fall. (l. 79–86)”</mark> [Page 216](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=216&annotation=MWQQ66DM)

- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"a revelation that unfolds in time. What is more, he suggests that Christ himself would have shared in that understanding. He argues that by focusing too much on the cross and suffering, Christians cannot stop ‘denigrating and devaluing what is of this world and which, after all, should fill us with joy and confidence’.31”</mark> [Page 220](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=220&annotation=VVJLS9GW) 
- <mark class="hltr-green">"Rilke and Andreas-Salomé came to see Russian people as, in Rilke’s words, ‘avatars of patience and endurance’ whose true potential will be revealed only in the future:  That biding quality in the Russian character (which the German, with his busy, self-important zeal for trifles, calls indolence—) would thus appear in a new, more revealing light: perhaps the Russian was meant to let the history of human beings pass him by, so that he might later enter with his singing heart into the harmony of things.43  The portrayal of Russian people as living by the heart (as opposed to the mind, associated with the West) and existing outside of history turns them into those who possess a spiritual depth that has been lost in the West”</mark> [Page 222](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=222&annotation=BWXPXJTG)

- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"ilke’s poetic portrayal of the Russian God in The Book of Hours and Stories of God explores the possibility of moving beyond the paradigm defined by the choice between the materialist rejection of religion and the endorsement of positivist philosophy (exemplified by Ludwig Feuerbach and Ernest Renan), on the one hand, and the defensive pronouncements of the Roman Catholic and Protestant ecclesiastics who began to adopt the rationalist paradigms of empirical science (in the spirit of Thomas Aquinas), on the other hand”</mark> [Page 224](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=224&annotation=IHA725T5) 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"‘The Eastern principle of passive devotion to the divine and the eternal’, he contended, ‘and the Western principle of man’s independent activity (through power and through freedom) will be harmonized and justified in the free and active service of the divine truth by all the powers of man’.61”</mark> [Page 225](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=225&annotation=N7H6348U) 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"the Christian East views Christ as a subject—‘the foundation of life, and not the object of aspiration’, whereas the Christian West considers Christ ‘an object of imitation and love [...] in the objective realm, and not the subjective’”</mark> [Page 226](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=226&annotation=Y5BIUIU8)

- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"If one were always to see in any kind of power, even in the painful and malicious one, the one great power itself, I mean that which ultimately and justly retains its claim to it, would one then not survive unharmed, so to speak, even the power that is unjust and arbitrary?78”</mark> [Page 228](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=228&annotation=RYDA6BZX)

- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"The universal religion is the fruit of a large tree, whose roots are formed from primitive Christianity, and whose trunk is formed from the religion of the Middle Ages. Modern Catholicism and contemporary Protestantism are withered and fruitless branches, ready to be pruned.”</mark> [Page 230](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=230&annotation=PEEE5TMY)

- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"To continue to represent him as bright and glowing is to insist on preserving an early form in which God revealed himself and ignore the meaning of the continuing evolution of Christian revelation.”</mark> [Page 231](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=231&annotation=8UPHWDSQ)

- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"In the Orthodox iconographic tradition, applying gold leaf to the icon’s background and painting small things in larger size symbolically indicate the change that takes place when the human and the divine meet.”</mark> [Page 234](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=234&annotation=S4C2UHNR) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"the monk who has been affected and touched through prayer paints an icon that is capable of touching other people, opening them up to the divine in a similar fashion”</mark> [Page 234](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=234&annotation=RGBI3GGT) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Rilke establishes the status of icon-painting as an act of both aesthetic and theological creativity”</mark> [Page 234](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=234&annotation=AWBUBBI5) 
- <mark class="hltr-green">"On his return to Germany, Rilke decorated his study with icons purchased in Russia”</mark> [Page 235](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=235&annotation=EDE94B68) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"both the traditional form of the icon and the individual experiences of the artist and the viewer hold value, and the meaning of the icon is born in their encounter”</mark> [Page 235](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=235&annotation=BMM4BYTH) 
- <mark class="hltr-green">"Rilke’s interest was in the relational space in which centuries-old iconographic forms can become a source of authentic religious experience for a contemporary believer. He asserts that both the traditional form of the icon and the individual experiences of the artist and the viewer hold value, and the meaning of the icon is born in their encounter”</mark> [Page 235](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=235&annotation=9KU3B2KP) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"It can happen that in the course of centuries the two forms, that of gestures and that of paintings, through repetition become empty, meaningless or burdened with misconceived content—but they are passed on with embarrassing precision, and if there comes a supplicant or an artist, full of true values, he will find a beautiful, simple vessel ready to receive his riches, a vessel that is great enough to hold everything, even the overflow.105”</mark> [Page 236](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=236&annotation=CTTCMQ5P)

- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The icon, thus, becomes a vessel that is revived by the contemporary viewer-supplicant in an experiential manner. Just like liturgical gestures, it acquires meaning through a prayerful event in which its form undergoes interpretation by a modern believer”</mark> [Page 236](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=236&annotation=KD9Y7FWR) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"By performing a religious ritual, he suggests, believers can through their praxis remove the dividing line between the inherited tradition and their lived experience”</mark> [Page 236](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=236&annotation=EL6MWLAN) 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"The believer’s engagement with the visual form of the icon, the verbal form of prayer, and the bodily form of gestures revives the inherited traditions and actualises their meaning.”</mark> [Page 236](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=236&annotation=WM8LWR52)

- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"the medieval icon—similarly to the medieval dogmas in the modernist theologians’ interpretation—does not seem to have a timeless, inherent meaning of its own. Its meaning is relational, born in an encounter with the viewer-supplicant”</mark> [Page 236](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=236&annotation=U5W2FAK5)

- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"the Orthodox ritual—of which icon veneration is a good example—‘still conveys God to Russians, no matter what the individual dogmas say about this God”</mark> [Page 237](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=237&annotation=TRGY5ZY2) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The sewing of these diverse fragments together produced what Florensky calls the ‘polycentric perspective’, which transcended a single human experience in order to embrace a larger, synthetic view of reality”</mark> [Page 238](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=238&annotation=8GEMJT6D) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"reverse perspective creates a challenge for the viewer, as they need to undertake a cognitive effort to re-create the synthetic image painted by the artist”</mark> [Page 238](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=238&annotation=VK4FI2Y3)

- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"in one beholder, it [the icon] will awaken in the bright clarities of his conscious mind a spiritual vision that matches directly the bright clarities of the icon; and the beholder’s vision will be comparably clear and conscious. But in another person, the icon will steer the dreams that lie deeper in the subconscious, awakening a perception of the spiritual that not only affirms that such seeing is possible but also brings the thing seen into immediately felt experience.119”</mark> [Page 238](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=238&annotation=RBT7YPUR) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"Since the icon’s meaning, according to Florensky, is co-created by the viewer, as such, it cannot be prescriptively determined.”</mark> [Page 238](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=238&annotation=CAYTZ2FQ)

- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The monks’ paintings are placed in the iconostasis to create a wall that in Orthodox churches separates the altar, as the holiest space, from the nave, where the faithful pray. The tension between the hearts that ‘behold’ God and the hands that ‘veil’ him points to the paradoxical dynamic of iconic representation, which offers a reflection on the human-divine relationship as requiring both proximity and distance”</mark> [Page 242](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=242&annotation=UANC5NRV) 
- <mark class="hltr-yellow">"The sketch that he worked on in a systematic way turned out to be a failure. It is only when he acknowledged that failure and experienced ‘uncertainty’ (l. 12) and disappointment that ‘the most pious of forms sprang forth’ (l. 13). The process of arriving at the final form of the painting is portrayed as out of the monk’s controlthe fact that the form ‘sprang forth’ underlines its givenness”</mark> [Page 243](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=243&annotation=ABWA2V8X) 
- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"We build on You with trembling hands and construct towers, atom upon atom. But who could ever complete You, You cathedral?142  The monk’s aspiration is to ‘complete’ God. While this might sound blasphemous, when read in parallel with contemporary Russian philosophers such as Vladimir Solovyov and Nicolas Berdyaev, who attempted to elevate the value of human creativity by exploring its spiritual dimension, it acquires a deeper theological meaning.”</mark> [Page 243](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=243&annotation=YMQ99RKB) 
- <mark class="hltr-green">"Solovyov thought would happen by means of religious aesthetics.

- <mark class="hltr-magenta">"Creative activity is the primary human response to the world that, as opposed to the scientific mindset that entails obedience to necessity, allows for an exercise of freedom. That freedom is best exemplified in art, which is ‘always a victory over the heaviness of “the world”—never adaptation to “the world”’.”</mark> [Page 245](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/APQ7X9E4?page=245&annotation=8KV4BK2B)
